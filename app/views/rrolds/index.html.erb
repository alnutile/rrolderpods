  There is a Ruby Rogues Parley Google Groups thread titled "Is there a way to download old Rogues episodes as podcasts?"
  I noticed this too on my Android phone. (<i>I was actually happy
   to realize there were 60 more to listen to!</i>). But then I thought
  heck I could make a feed in rails to help learn rails. So here is a go at it.
  </br><i>The code "quality" of this site in no way should reflect the quality of the RR Podcast! <i class="icon-thumbs-up"></i></i>

<table class="table-hover table-bordered ">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>#</th>
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Size MB</th>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Edit</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<% @rrolds.each do |rrold| %>
  <tr>
    <td class="text-center"><%= rrold.enumber %></td>
    <td><%= link_to rrold.name, rrold.url %></td>
    <td class="text-center"><%= rrold.size %></td>
    <td class="text-center"><%= rrold.created_at.to_date()  %></td>
    <td class="edit-link text-center"><%= link_to(edit_rrold_path(rrold)) do %> 
      <i class="icon-pencil"></i>
      <% end %>
    </td>
  </tr>
<% end %>
</table>
